        ## Purpose of the tool

        This tool aims to achieve a number of things;
1.	Grow the general knowledge of Embodied Carbon within the architectural community.
2.	Compare early stage design options for the embodied carbon of different structural solutions.
3.	Cause individual users to ask further questions about where the carbon is and what to do about reducing it.
4.	Help to build an industry wide conversation on how to build better now!

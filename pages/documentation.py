            It can also help identify what floor is causing the issue if a redesign or alteration is required. \
            In essense the app helps you interrogate your designs and find improvements that can be made. \

                    The Embodied Carbon App results will only ever be as accurate as your data/model. So to maximise accuracy, we'd recommend conducting some model audits before exporting.  
                    Exactly how this is done is very dependent on your software, but as a quick guide, this is what we did (in ArchiCAD): 
                    - Isolate the materials in the model to more easily conduct a visual check of steel/concrete/timber. This was done with a series of corresponding layer combinations
                    - Set up a series of schedules and 3d views (based on same layer combinations) with graphic overrides ato easily conduct a visual check of the structural elements
                    Some specific things you might need to look out for: 
                    - Overlapping elements - eg slabs/beams/columns - are they being calculated more than once?
                    - Objects on incorrect layers/classification/etc - depending on how your final schedule is collated, there may be extraneous or missing items 
                    - Consistent material names
                    **A few things to note **
                    Staging/renovation status: demolished/existing/new elements are not differentiated. So, to separate these out youlll need to have separate datasets.

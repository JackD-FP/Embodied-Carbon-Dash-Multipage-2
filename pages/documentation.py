            It is obvious to us that timber is far less carbon intense than concrete and steel.\
            However, when it comes to actual buildings where mixtures of materials are necessary for structural stability, the answer is less obvious. \
            The App can help identify which material is carbon intense and check if there are alternatives less carbon intense to the later. \
            It can also help identify what floor is causing the issue if a redesign or alteration is required. \
            In essense the app helps you interrogate your designs and find improvements that can be made. \
